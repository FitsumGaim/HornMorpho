HornMorpho is one of the pioneering works in Natural Language Processing of Tigrinya, Amharic, and Oromo by [Prof. Michael Gasser][gasser].

This repository adopts the code from version 2.5 of the project which was released on 2012-07-11 (the last official release I know), in the hope of keeping it alive and adding value to it.
